    <p id="rcorners1">League of Legends is a free 5v5 online MOBA game created and published by Riot Games. The end-game objective of the game is to destroy the enemy team's nexus, located deep into their base. Before doing so, players split into roles and head into lanes where they must kill minions for gold, battle enemy players and destroy their structures. Players choose champions in order to play the game, with all champions having unique abilities and roles. There is also a jungle with a wide variety of jungle monsters, as well as neutral monsters that can be killed by both teams such as Baron Nashor, Elemental Drakes or Elder Drake. The killing of these monsters grants different bonuses and rewards.
